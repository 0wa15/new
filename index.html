                        <p>I came to Canada about three years ago when I was 16. Since then, I've picked up English, gotten used to a different way of learning, and found some cool opportunities for my future.</p>

                        <p>I got better fast by talking with friends who don't speak Arabic, working as a cashier, and just being in school.</p>
                        <p>Learning English wasn't that hard for me because I actually enjoyed it. I'm pretty happy with how much I've improved, but I still want to get even better.</p>

                        <p>Back in Syria, I did great in grades 1-6, but Turkey was tough. I had to repeat grade 7, did grade 8 online during COVID, and really struggled in grade 9 before we moved here.</p>
                        <p>Canadian schools are way easier and more supportive. The teachers and other kids are nice, especially to newcomers. We only have four classes each day with the same schedule, which helps me stay focused.</p>
                        <p>I really like how sports matter here. In Syria and Turkey, we just had one PE class a week, but here it's actually important - you even need it to graduate!</p>
